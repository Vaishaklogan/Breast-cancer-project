🩺 Breast Cancer Detection & Clustering using Machine Learning
🔬 What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer is a disease that originates in the cells of the breast, most commonly in the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) of glandular tissue. In its early stage, cancerous growth remains localized ("in situ"), causing minimal symptoms and little risk of spreading. However, if not detected early, it can metastasize and become life-threatening.

While most breast cancers can be diagnosed through microscopic analysis or biopsy, some types require more specialized lab examinations. That’s where the power of machine learning comes in — to assist in earlier, faster, and more scalable detection.

🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the presence of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms based on internal physical characteristics of a patient’s tumor cells. These features include:

radius_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, concavity_mean,

concave points_mean, compactness_mean, radius_worst,

perimeter_worst, area_worst, concave points_worst

The model is trained to classify tumors as benign or malignant, allowing early detection and ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of breast cancer going undiagnosed.

🔄 Clean Workflow
The project follows a clear and structured machine learning pipeline:

✅ Data Preprocessing
Reads and cleans the dataset (drops unnecessary columns like id and unnamed columns).

Handles missing values to ensure clean input.

Applies label encoding on the target variable (diagnosis) for ML compatibility.

Uses standard scaling to normalize all feature values.

(Optionally) applies one-hot encoding – although label encoding suffices in this binary classification case.

🧠 Model Building
Uses Logistic Regression as the primary classifier.

Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split with a fixed random_state for reproducibility.

📈 Model Evaluation
Evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

These metrics give a holistic view of how well the model is performing.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Count Plot of diagnoses to visualize class imbalance or distribution.

Correlation Heatmap to understand relationships among features and identify the most influential ones.

🔍 Clustering in Breast Cancer Prediction
This project also includes unsupervised learning using clustering algorithms to analyze natural groupings in the data:

1. Understanding Natural Groupings
Even without using the diagnosis label, clustering reveals whether benign and malignant cases naturally form separate clusters. This gives us confidence in the feature separability.

2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce high-dimensional data into 2D for visualization.

After dimensionality reduction, clustering (e.g., K-Means) is applied, making it easier to visualize data separations.

3. Anomaly Detection
Clustering also helps identify outliers — tumor samples that don’t fit typical benign or malignant profiles. This can flag potential edge cases or errors in the dataset.

The clusters were found to align closely with the actual diagnosis, proving that the internal cell features used are highly effective in distinguishing cancerous from non-cancerous cases.
